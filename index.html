    <hr>
    <p>In 1994 South Africa transitioned from an apartheid government to a full democracy. Under the apartheid regime the black majority was oppressed and disenfranchised by the white minority.  In order to hold the perpetrators accountable and heal the deep divisions within the country the new government formed the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in 1996. 
<br></br>
The TRC was made up of three main committees:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Human Rights Violations Committee investigated human rights abuses that occurred between 1960 and 1994.</li>
        <li>The Reparation and Rehabilitation Committee was charged with restoring victims' dignity and formulating proposals to assist with rehabilitation.</li>
        <li>The Amnesty Committee considered applications from individuals who applied for amnesty in accordance with the provisions of the Act.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>During televised hearings victims and perpetrators testified to the commission. While the commision was not universally accepted, the vast majority of South Africans saw it as positive step towards national and racial unity. Since then the model of the TRC has been used in other countries to confront institutionalised discrimination and crimes against humanity.
